                decision-maker. Hence, every child must be educated so that they can lead a happy life.</p>

                matter of fact, Rukmini and Omana are themselves underweight. They do not have the government provided
                ration cards as they are unaware of the procedures to procure one. Lack of education and awareness continues
                to take a heavy toll on such families. They are just one among the many such families. </p>
